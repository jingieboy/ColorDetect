# ColorDetect
Color recognition software using Python

## About
In this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with this Python project with source code, you should be familiar with the computer vision library of Python that is OpenCV and Pandas.OpenCV, Pandas, and numpy are the Python packages that are necessary for this project in Python. To install them, simply run this pip command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pandas
```


## Run Python File
You can run the Python file from the command prompt. Make sure to give an image path using ‘-i’ argument. If the image is in another directory, then you need to give full path of the image:

```
python color_detection.py -i <add your image path here>
```
